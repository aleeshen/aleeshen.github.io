  Using acceptance rates, admission yield rates, student/faculty ratios, and SAT scores, I clustered the US colleges offering doctoral degrees, and showed the between-group difference in distribution for three selected features. Group 4, consisting of some top colleges, is highlighted in red in the bar plots.
  <br><br>
  I also added some information for several college that people can see by just hovering over them on the map.
  <br><br>
  Also you can check out the full result by clicking the link above.

  Visualization is an effective way to identify patterns, outliers, and even errors in data, especially for large and messy sets of data. In this project, I was able to spot an error in the College Scorecard about the geographical location of a college in Florida, Ana G. Mendez University (<a href=https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?483595-Ana-G-Mendez-University target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collegescorecard.ed.gov - link to this college</a>). As shown in the above, at the bottom right of the screenshot we can see that this college was mapped to Puerto Rico by mistake. This error is similarly seen (at the time of writing) with the map in the website at <a href=https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?483595-Ana-G-Mendez-University target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> collegescorecard.ed.gov</a>. I am contacting the website for a correction.

  Using the data collected in the first project, I have built a dashboard app using Python package Streamlit. The purpose is to provide a quick way for users to learn the basic facts about a college by just hovering.  Select a State and then College from the sidebar menus to label all associated schools with markers on map. Hovering over the markers will display some facts, and clicking on the selected one will provide further info in a popup.
  <br><br>
  A screenshot in below demonstrates the basic utilities of the app. Please try the app for details, either locally or on Streamlit Cloud following the above link (deployment is NOT through yet at the time of editing). It is compatible with Google Chrome browser and is known to have an issue for popup with Safari.

    Image data is being explosively generated nowadays, making image processing becoming an important field in computer and data science. It has broad applications in medical imaging, computer vision, robotics, industrial inspection, etc. 
        
    <br><br>
    Python is one of the popular tools for this purpose. I am interested in using Python to process images. I have started learning some basic operations, such as resizing, denoising, and segmentation. Deep learning is a great approach for many tasks in this field, and it is something one has to grasp and use.
    <br><br>
    
    In the link below, I put together several pictures, showing some frequently used processing procedures.

     I also tried to blend two pictures after some processing: playing soccer on the <i>foot</i>print.
     <br><br>
     For two pictures to be merged, they must be of the same size. It took me a while to resize pictures without stretching them (changing the width/height ratio); this created some extra spaces on the edges. I tried to fill the spaces with the color that best matched the main part.
