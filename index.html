  Using acceptance rates, admission yield rates, student/faculty ratios, and SAT scores, I clustered the US colleges providing doctoral degrees, and show the between-group difference in distribution for three selected features. Group 4, consisting of some prestigious colleges, is highlighted in red in the bar plots.
  <br><br>
  I also localized colleges on map with some information viewable by hovering or clicking mouse. 
  <br><br>
  Two screenshots in below demonstrate some of the outcomes. Please see the webpage of the result by following the above link for details.

  Visualization is an effective way to identify patterns and outliers, even errors, in data, especially for large and messy datasets. For example, in this project, I easily spotted an error in the College Scorecard about the geographical location of a Florida college, Ana G. Mendez University (<a href=https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?483595-Ana-G-Mendez-University target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> collegescorecard.ed.gov - link to this college </a>). 
  <br><br>
  In above screenshots, we can see that this college was mapped to Puerto Rico by mistake at the bottom right corner. Similarly, the error can be observed from the map in the website at <a href=https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?483595-Ana-G-Mendez-University target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> collegescorecard.ed.gov</a>. I am contacting the website for a correction.

  Using the data collected in the last project, I have built a dashboard app using python package Streamlit. The purpose is to provide a quick way for users to learn the basic facts about a college by just hovering and clicking. To use it, we can select a State and then College from the sidebar menus to localize all associated schools on map with markers. Hovering over all of the markers will display some facts, and clicking the selected one, which is distinctly displayed as a star marker, will also provide more information in a popup frame. More facts can be added later on.
  <br><br>
  A screenshot in below demonstrates the basic function of the app. Please try the app (to be deployed) by following the above link for details. This app is compatible with Google Chome browser, but is known to have an issue for popup with Safari.
