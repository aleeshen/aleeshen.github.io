  Using acceptance rates, admission yield rates, student/faculty ratios, and SAT scores, I clustered the US colleges offering doctoral degrees, and showed the between-group difference in distribution for three selected features. Group 4, consisting of some prestigious colleges, is highlighted in red in the bar plots.
  <br><br>
  I also localized colleges on map with some information viewable by hovering or clicking mouse. This project wsa complemented with Python packages.
  <br><br>
  Two screenshots below demonstrate some of the outcomes. Please see the webpage of the result by following the above link for details.

  Visualization is an effective way to identify patterns, outliers, and even errors, in data, especially for large and messy datasets. For example, in this project, I easily spotted an error in the College Scorecard about the geographical location of a Florida college, Ana G. Mendez University (<a href=https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?483595-Ana-G-Mendez-University target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collegescorecard.ed.gov - link to this college</a>). As shown in the above, at the bottom right of the screenshot we can see that this college was mapped to Puerto Rico by mistake. This error is similarly seen (at the time of writing) with the map in the website at <a href=https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?483595-Ana-G-Mendez-University target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> collegescorecard.ed.gov</a>. I am contacting the website for a correction.

  Using the data collected in the first project, I have built a dashboard app using Python package Streamlit. The purpose is to provide a quick way for users to learn the basic facts about a college by just hovering and clicking. To use it, we can select a State and then College from the sidebar menus to label all associated schools with markers on map. Hovering over the markers will display some facts, and clicking on the selected one, which is distinctly displayed as a star marker, will provide further information in a popup frame. More facts can be added later on.
  <br><br>
  A screenshot in below demonstrates the basic utilities of the app. Please try the app for details, either locally or on Streamlit Cloud following the above link (deployment is not through yet at the time of editing). It is compatible with Google Chrome browser and is known to have an issue for popup with Safari.
